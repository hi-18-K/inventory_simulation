# warehouse_simulation
This is WareHouse simulation, we created in e-Yantra Robotics Competition. This project consists of simulation of two robotic arms UR5_1 and UR5_2 in warehouse environment. 


##### Environment configurations were provided by e-Yantra Team (IIT Bombay) themselves. We were to understand those to fit our motion planning and trajectory files appropriately. 
Their GitHub Repo for the same is:

#### <p align='center'>  We have used: </p>
1) Concepts of Basic ROS 
2) Concepts of IoT - Network Protocols - sending and recieving data via HTTP and MQTT with python
3) MoveIt motion planning (which is an open source motion planning framework for Robotic Simulation).
4) TF (for converting co-ordinates from one frame of reference to another - at later stages did this manually too)
5) Google App Scripting
6) Javascript, HTML, CSS for making web interface for placing orders and displaying dashboard
